## BoatSimulator
**A Java-based game meant to improve both my Java and naval skills alike in the game Sea of Thieves.**

This project takes much inspiration from the game Sea of Thieves (Rare LTD, 2018), incorporating many time constants from it and 1 image (the boat) from it. Its goal is to be as accurate as possible to give an offline experience of player vs. player naval combat.

[kilt-graphics](https://github.com/mac-comp127/kilt-graphics/blob/main/README.md) lies at the heart of the project, making it streamlined and nice to work with.
